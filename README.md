# Liming Zheng — Personal Academic Website

This repository hosts the source code of my personal academic website: [https://limingzheng.com](https://limingzheng.com).  
The website presents my research on bio-inspired aerial robotics, morphing-wing drone design, and related publications and projects.

## 🛠️ Framework

The site is built with **[Hugo Blox](https://docs.hugoblox.com/)** — an open-source framework for academic and personal websites.  
Specifically, it is based on the **Academic-CV theme**, which provides modular sections for publications, projects, and posts.

This repository is **adapted from**:

- [yun-long/yun-long.github.io](https://github.com/yun-long/yun-long.github.io) — a great example of a clean academic homepage.
- [HugoBlox/theme-academic-cv](https://github.com/HugoBlox/theme-academic-cv) — the original Hugo Blox Academic-CV template.

I customized the content, layout, and style to fit my own research and identity.

## 🚀 Deployment

The website is automatically built and deployed using **GitHub Actions** to  
**GitHub Pages** at [https://Liming-Zheng.github.io](https://Liming-Zheng.github.io),  
and is also available via my custom domain [https://limingzheng.com](https://limingzheng.com).
